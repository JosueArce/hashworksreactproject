# NYT Books React + TypeScript App

This project is a simple React + TypeScript application that displays New York Times best seller books using the NYT Books API. It features two main screens: a list of best seller books and a detail view for each book. The app is responsive and works on major browsers, including mobile.

## Features

- List of NYT best seller books
- Detail view for each book
- Responsive, modern UI (no full UI kits)
- TypeScript throughout
- Unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library

## Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or newer recommended)
- npm (v6 or newer)
- A New York Times Books API key ([get one here](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/books-product/1/overview))

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure your NYT API key:**

   - Update the `.env` file in the project root:

     ```sh
     echo "REACT_APP_NYT_API_KEY=luydo7iA2JcaEZHg1YmzgyUxgGijoByt" > .env
     ```

   - The included demo/test API key is: `luydo7iA2JcaEZHg1YmzgyUxgGijoByt`
